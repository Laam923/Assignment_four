     <p>The Hong Kong Government has tightened the social distancing measures during the pandemic, most of the entertainment premises need to suspend its operation such as Amusement game centres, Amusement Parks, Karaoke and Party Rooms etc. </p>
     <br> </br>   
     <p> My family members can only buy board games to have fun during weekends or long holidays. However, each of the board games costs us a few hundred dollars, and we cannot ensure if the game is fun to play. We have to buy it first and experience ourselves. We need to take the risk as sometimes we bought a board game and realized it is not fun at all, we can either sell it online or let it stay at the corner. </p>
        <br> </br>    
        <p>We can only visit discussion forums and board game reviews website and try to discover which board game is fun to play. Board Game Greek (https://boardgamegeek.com/)  is one of the largest board game review websites, we can make reference to the reviews of board games and decide which one to buy.</p>
                <p>The user’s data provided to Board Game Greek is vulnerable, and we don’t have a website that introduces board games in Hong Kong. I think it is a good chance for me to explore the data by using the knowledge that I have learned from the course to discover the following in my website:</p>
                <br> </br>
                <li> Users’ top 10 board game with the highest rating</li>
                    <li> The most owned Top 10 board games </li>
                        <li> The most wanted Top 10 board games </li>
                            <li> The most wished Top 10 board games</li>
                                <li> Number of  board games published each year</li>
                                    <li> Users’ top 10 board game themes </li>
                                    <br> </br>
                                    <p> Therefore, I want to build a website based on the data from BBG and introduce the different board games to Hong Kong board game players (like a Board Game version of  Open Rice). Also, to promote some small board game shops as the details of the shops that sell board games are fragmented currently. The website will include the following functions to make this website sustainable in the long run:</p>
                                    <br> </br>
                                    <li> Work with small board game shops/ board game café to organize local board game tournaments</li>
                                        <li> To let the players sell/ exchange their old/ unwanted board games</li>
                                            <li> Provide a platform and let the small board game shops/ board game café promote themselves </li>
                                                <li> Provide a platform for the board game addicts to share their tactics towards different kinds of board game</li>
